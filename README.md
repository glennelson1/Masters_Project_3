Evolutionary Approach 

Initialize Population – creates the initial level sequence that the approach will evolve.
Evaluate Population – gives the level sequence a fitness score based on uniqueness.
Selection – selects good sub segments of the sequence to save for later generations.
Crossover – Allows for crossover from previous generation.
Adjust Mutation Rate - adjusts the chance of randomness of the generations, randomness will decrease over time.
Mutation – Allows for randomness to be introduced within the sequence. 
Spawn Grid From Genome – creates the level from the sequence create by the Procedural approach.
This process repeats currently for 100 generations
